Today i practice the previous all commands.
 
first i create the two new repositiry and i practice all command on that repositiry and
i also get one error during git push command and error is "The current branch branch2 has 
no upstream branch.To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, 
use git push --set-upstream origin branch2" so it also give the solution and i also check what 
is upstream branch.


Today i also practice commands like

1.git branch -d <branch-name>

2.touch filename.extention or echo> filename

3.git status -s

4.git checkout -f

5.git rm filename

6.git rm --cached file name 
i also learn the diffirence between "git rm" and "git rm --cached".
